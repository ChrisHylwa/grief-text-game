You feel nausceous, and start hyperventilating. You struggle through dark spots and white flashes, eventually renouncing sight altogether. You trip on something squishy. You can't get up, and the squishyness is crawling up your leg. You wish you had your knife. You hate this. You hate this so much. You hate this enough to grab the thing and squeeze and squeeze until it cracks and you throw it against the bloody wall and walk over to it and stomp it to bits. You notice tiny globs emerging from the carcass and oozing towards you. You run back to the old door and open it. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an anger emotion here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Room&#x000A;As you enter the next room, you smell blood and taste the gnarling cacaphoney of a broken record. Splashes of dried blood cover the walls; everything in the room is sinking and stained.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a stuffed bear, a photographs and a sailboat here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
